Made with Chakra UI, using the Style Props features. In this way, CSS code is used as props to React Components instead of creating separate CSS stylesheets, this is considered to be a step-forward from SCSS, CSS-in-JS and Styled-components by many. These "style props" compile into css using the same attributes but higher code readibility.
